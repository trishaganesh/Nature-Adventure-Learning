            <h2>Importance of our Cause</h2>
            Every student learns differently. However, it's important to 
            acknowledge these differences and provide comfort and support for 
            students to make them feel included and supported. For decades 
            students, particularly those with learning disabilities, have faced 
            difficulties overcoming fears of judgment and question their 
            aptitude when it comes to their learning goals and aspirations in 
            life. Like others, they too seek fulfillment in what they do. Rather
             than criticizing a student for their differences, itâ€™s important to
              embrace them wholeheartedly and ensure they receive the resources 
              fitted for their learning style.
            However, in spite of each student having varying abilities, nature can provide suitable learning environment for students of all learning backgrounds while simultaneously improving their mental and psychological wellbeing.
