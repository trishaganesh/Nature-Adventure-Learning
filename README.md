## Project Category
Educational Social Impact

## Key elements (what we built)
An informative website + memory game for students to play allowing them to be more attentive and creative while learning in the process

## Inspiration
As students with varying learning abilities, we understand the importance of having an effective, supportive learning environment. We've witnessed the lack of care for students, specifically those with learning disabilities or various other styles of learning. In environments where every student learns at a different pace/speed, it's important to acknowledge those differences and embrace them wholeheartedly. 

Nature Adventure Learning is designed to help reach all students regardless of learning style and ability. By connecting and learning with nature, students can feel a positive influence on their mental and physical well-being while being supported by their educators. By gaining information about the benefits of learning in nature and playing our interactive memory game, students can then decide if they'd like Nature Adventure Learning.

## Impact this project will have
In addition, to helping students improve their mental and physical wellbeing positively impacting their learning performance, students of varying learning abilities will feel more inclined to seek support and guidance furthering them in their personal, academic, and overall educational goals. 

Simply put, our cause is dedicated to acknowledging, recognizing, and believing in students of all learning styles/types and helping them thrive wherever they go and whatever they put their minds to. 

## Challenges we ran into
### 1) Website
A challenge we ran into was the functionality portion of the contact form on our website. We eventually decided to use the Firebase Realtime Database where when the user inputs any contact information, the data is stored. 

### 2) Game
It was interesting to build a game using only CSS and JS. The majority of the game heavily relied on JavaScript functionality and it was initially a challenge to place the elements in their designated spot and then find a way to allow the elements of the game to flip (hide) when the student types the tiles to view the actual element.
