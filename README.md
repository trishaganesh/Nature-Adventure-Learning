## Project Category
Educational Social Impact

## Key elements (what we built)
An informative website + memory game students to play allowing them to be more attentive and creative while learning in the process

## Inspiration
As students with varying learning abilities, we understand the importance of having an effective, supportive learning environment. We've witnessed the lack of care for students, specifically those with learning disabilities or various other styles of learning. In environments where every student learns at a different pace/speed, it's important to acknowledge those differences and embrace them wholeheartedly. Nature Adventure Learning is designed to help reach all students regardless of learning style and ability. By connecting and learning with nature, students can feel a positive influence on their mental and physical well-being while being supported by their educators. By gaining information about the benefits of learning in nature and playing our interactive memory game, students can then decide if they'd like Nature Adventure Learning.

## Impact this project will have

## Challenges we ran into
### Website
A challenge we ran into was the JS functionality portion for the contact form on our website. We eventually decided to use the Firebase Realtime Database where when the user inputs any contact information, the data is stored.
